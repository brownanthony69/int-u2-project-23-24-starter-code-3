    <p style="font-family: monospace;"> The school-to-prison pipeline is a disturbing societal phenomenon where the
      policies and practices within the education system contribute to the increased likelihood of students,
      particularly those from marginalized communities, becoming involved in the criminal justice system.

    <p style="font-family: monospace;"> The school-to-prison pipeline affects students of color, those with
      disabilities, and those from marginalized
      communities. It can lead to a lack of access to education, a lack of opportunities for learning and others.
