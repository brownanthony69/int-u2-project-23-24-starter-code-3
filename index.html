    <p style="font-family: monospace;">
      The connection between prisons and schools in the United States is often referred to as the "school-to-prison pipeline." This term describes the various policies and practices within the education and criminal justice systems that contribute to a pathway where students, particularly those from marginalized communities, are funneled from schools into the criminal justice system. The school-to-prison pipeline is a disturbing societal phenomenon where the
      policies and practices within the education system contribute to the increased likelihood of students,
      particularly those from marginalized communities, becoming involved in the criminal justice system.

    <h1 class="header-2"><u> Who it Affects</u></h1>
    <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 2 below. -->
    <p style="font-family: monospace;"> The school-to-prison pipeline affects students of color, those with
      disabilities, and those from marginalized
      communities. It can lead to a lack of access to education, a lack of opportunities for learning and others.
      According to the <a
        href="https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2021-07-27/study-confirms-school-to-prison-pipeline">US
        News</a> the school-to-prison pipeline is a major issue in the United States. "The impacts are significantly
      more predictive for Black and Hispanic boys who attended strict middle schools. Black and Hispanic girls are more
      likely to be incarcerated than white girls."

    <p style="font-family: monospace;">Several factors contribute to the development of the school-to-prison pipeline
      such as:

      Zero-tolerance policies: Many schools have implemented zero-tolerance policies for certain behaviors, leading to
      harsh and automatic punishment, often involving law enforcement. This can disproportionately affect students of
      color and those with disabilities.

      School discipline practices: Excessive use of suspensions, expulsions, and other punitive measures can contribute
      to students disengaging from school and, in some cases, becoming involved in the criminal justice system.

      Over-policing in schools: Some schools have a significant presence of law enforcement, leading to an increased
      likelihood of students being arrested for minor offenses. This can create a hostile environment and contribute to
      the criminalization of students.

      Socioeconomic factors: Students from low-income communities may face additional challenges, such as lack of access
      to quality education, economic instability, and limited resources, which can contribute to the likelihood of
      involvement in the criminal justice system.

      Racial disparities: There are significant racial disparities in the school-to-prison pipeline, with students of
      color, particularly African American and Latino students, experiencing higher rates of disciplinary actions and
      involvement in the criminal justice system.</p>
